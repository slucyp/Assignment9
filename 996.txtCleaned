In Lebanon, the ICRC's work includes visiting detainees and finding missing persons.
 We are helping displaced people fleeing war and violence across the region and the communities hosting them.
The ICRC's protection coordinator in Beirut is Dan Mac Sweeney, from Cork in Ireland.
 In this podcast, he talks about what the ICRC is doing in Lebanon.
The ICRC has been present in Lebanon since 1967, carrying out humanitarian work through periods of conflict including the 1975-1990 civil war.
This is the first in a new series of audio podcasts about the work of the ICRC across the world, produced by the ICRC's UK and Ireland mission.
